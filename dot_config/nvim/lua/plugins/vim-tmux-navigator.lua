-- Vim-tmux-navigator is a little plugin which enables seamless navigation
-- between tmux panes and vim splits. This plugin is a repackaging of Mislav
-- Marohinc's tmux=navigator configuration. When combined with a set of tmux key
-- bindings, the plugin will allow you to navigate seamlessly between vim and
-- tmux splits using a consistent set of hotkeys.
